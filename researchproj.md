## Important dates


**Topic selection due**:   {{ site.content.topic_selection_ddl }}.

**Abstract and Preliminary Reference List due**:   {{ site.content.abstract_ddl }}.

**Final report Due**:   {{ site.content.report_ddl }}.


## The Assignment

For this assignment you will complete a literature review on a topic related to data privacy and approved by the instructor. 

By {{ site.content.topic_selection_ddl }}, you need to have entered your topic on this GoogleDoc. (But see below for details about topics.) Note that everyone should choose a different topic. Feel free to discuss potential topics with the instructor prior to that.

By {{ site.content.abstract_ddl }}, you need to turn in a preliminary abstract (about 1 page) and reference list (no page limit).  Please upload your abstract to Canvas. Acceptable file formats are Microsoft Word or PDF. Be sure the filename starts with your last name, like: Myers-Brad-LitReviewAbstract.pdf.

The final literature review is due {{ site.content.report_ddl }}. Please upload this to Canvas as well, and use the same naming conventions. If you turn your paper in by May 10, I will try to provide feedback in time for you to fix it, if you want.

The length of your report should be approximately between 8-15 pages in length (body text, not including the list of references) in Times New Roman 12 point font double spaced, or equivalent. Having figures and pictures are a good idea, but they do not count as part of your page count. As a general guideline, a typical literature review has about 15 to 30 total references. Remember that good writing and grammar count.
