- This course schedule and reading list are tentative and might change as the quarter progresses.

- The URLs of the online forms and the deadlines for submitting the paper reviews are listed alongside each paper; the deadline time is 8:59 AM PST on the deadline date.

- If no URL is provided, you do not need to submit reviews for that particular paper, but it is still required reading and will be discussed during the lectures.

- Papers without URLs that are also marked as “(Optional)” are not required readings, but they might come up in the lectures; at least skim reading these would be helpful for you.

- Please try to attend all the lectures and participate in the discussions.
