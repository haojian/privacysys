## Discussion leaders

Each student will select a class session to be the co-discussion-leader. 
Since there are XX students and 8 sessions. Each session will have 2 co-leaders. The co-leaders together will be responsible for summarizing and presenting all 3 of the required papers for that session. The co-leaders are also welcome to discuss the optional readings if you want. Also, if there are find other readings you think should be added, please let the professor know. We will assign the leaders through a Google Sheets signup (class access only), and negotiation.

<!-- The leader can work it out among themselves how to divide the time and work, but all students are expected to take at least some of the presenting time.  -->
The goal is to encourage discussions that delve deeply into the readings, explore their implications and applicability, show how they fit into a broader intellectual context, etc. You can assume that your fellow students have read each article, so you don't need to summarize an article in detail unless the article is especially difficult to understand, or if pre-class discussion forum activity indicates that others are missing important points or misunderstanding the article. Instead, focus your summary of the articles on highlighting the main points you want the class to discuss and explaining how these tie into the larger research landscape.


## How-to
In preparing for your summary and presentation, you should identify what you think is important about the papers. Some questions you might want to answer in a summary include:

- What is the goal of the paper?
- Did the authors achieve it?
- What was their method?
- What are the flaws in the work?
- What claim is made by the paper?
- What is the appropriate way to evaluate that claim?
- Have the authors achieved that evaluation?
- What has the impact of the research been?
- Who are the authors?
- Have they done groundbreaking work in this area, contributed incremental next steps, or are they perhaps just starting out (maybe they're still students)?


To answer these questions (and others), you need to understand the paper's intellectual context. This means looking up the authors and their work; skimming some of the things it references, and using a tool like Google Scholar to find out what has referenced it, and possibly skimming some of those. You will also need to understand how the paper relates to other readings from the class.  

For each summary that your group is in charge of, you will need to first provide a summary of the three articles to Canvas Discussions. Each paper should already have an entry I created in Canvas Discussions, and you can fill in your summary as the first reply, and then the rest of the class will add their discussion items. The deadline for adding your summary of the three articles is: before midnight two days before class. That is, posted by Sunday night for Tuesday’s class, by Tuesday night for Thursday’s class. Please be sure the summary is the first item for each article. You should also monitor the students' discussion, and you should reply to people’s comments on your summary if you think they are misunderstanding the paper or your summary. Please do not add content-free responses like "Thanks".

## Presentation slides
You also need to prepare some slides to present in class. The slides should be made with Google Slides. Please name your slide file with the the class and year (05773s2021-), the lecture number, and the first word in the session title (I made each session have a useful first word!). For example, 05773s2021-01-Course Intro. If you make different slide files for each presenter or for each article, please concatenate them together before turning in your slides. Your first or second slide must contain:

- The class session number and name
- The full names of all the presenters
- The list of articles being discussed, with the full citation (as in the schedule)

You need to upload the slides (or a shortcut) to them into the class Google Drive at least 2 hours before class (that is, before 8:30am EDT) on the day of your presentation. (It is fine to fix errors and update your slides after the link is posted and even during class, but please make sure they are complete before 8:30am.) Make sure the slides have the right permissions so they are viewable at least by the class. I prefer that they be viewable publically, or at least by everyone at CMU, but if you want, you can use the class list.

As a guideline, I expect the presentation to be about 7 minutes per reading, leaving about 60 minutes for discussion. Again, the co-leaders for that session can decide how to break it up -- doing the papers separately, each with its own discussion, or presenting about 2 or all 3 together, and then discussing them all at the end, or some other organization.


## Peer feedback
The students in the class will evaluate your presentation using this form: [TBD](). Students should provide their feedback preferably the same day, but no later than noon the following day, so I can get the feedback back to the speakers in a timely manner.
