## Course Overview and Goals

Privacy is changing how we build data systems. Recent regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) require developers to offer greater privacy protections. However, practitioners struggle to turn these high-level privacy principles into low-level code implementation. This course will introduce the widely adopted privacy principles, discuss the system research associated with each principle, and use these principles to analyze a few real-world privacy-sensitive data systems (e.g., Apple AirTag, Covid-19 Contact tracing systems). Students will learn privacy-relevant technologies and integrate perspectives that span product design, software development, cybersecurity, human-computer interaction, and business and legal considerations.



## Administrivia

**Lectures**: TueThu 05:00PM-06:20PM; Warren Lecture Hall (WLH) 2208

**Instructor**: [Haojian Jin](http://haojianj.in/); Office: SDSC 214E; Office Hours: Tue 2:00-3:00pm


## Course Project

- Each student has to do either a research project or a survey project. The choice has to be indicated in the questionnaire and will have to finalized before {{ site.content.topic_selection_ddl }} with an email sent to the instructor.

- **Research Project**: Students choosing to do a research project are encouraged to propose a relevant problem (subject to the consent of the instructor) or choose a problem suggested by the instructor and email the final choice to the instructor before {{ site.content.topic_selection_ddl }}. The research projects will ideally lay the groundwork for a publication at a top research conference or workshop. Students are encouraged to do individual research projects but groups of two students each are permitted for projects with a larger scope. Each student (or group) has to meet face to face with the instructor at a mutually scheduled half-hour slot every other week to discuss the progress on the project.

- **Survey Project**: Students choosing to do a survey project have to pick one of the course topics and survey the major relevant research papers on that topic. The final choice must be emailed to the instructor before {{ site.content.topic_selection_ddl }}. Survey projects are restricted to be individual projects and are expected to provide a comprehensive analysis of a topic beyond just summarizing the papers as a laundry list. Each student has to meet with the instructor at a mutually scheduled slot once within the first month of the class to finalize the list of papers that will be surveyed.

- **Project Report**: Each student (or group) has to submit a paper-style report of length 6-12 pages on their research project or survey project by the end of the course. The ACM SIG proceedings LaTeX template should be used for the report. The deadline for emailing the report is {{ site.content.report_ddl }}.


## Course Content and Format

- The course will be based primarily on a reading list of about 30 recent papers from top conferences such as SIGCHI, Ubicomp, S&P, Usenix Secuirty, CCS, and NSDI, organized into topics.

- Each student has to read and submit their individual reviews of about 18 specified papers in the reading list by the deadline corresponding to each paper. The reviews will have a prescribed format and will have to be submitted via a given Google Form (not via email). See the Schedule for more details. For some advice on how to read a research paper with an evaluative but also appreciative mindset, read this excellent article: [How to Read a Paper](http://ccr.sigcomm.org/online/files/p83-keshavA.pdf).

- There will be two 75-minute lectures per week (Tue and Thu) by the instructor on the topics, techniques, and papers (mostly from the reading list). Each topic will span about 2 lectures. The lectures will also involve discussions about the reading list papers. All students are expected to read all the assigned papers and participate in the discussions.

- Each student is expected to present a <span style="color:blue">**7-min talk**</span> about their project to the class. All students are expected to attend all talks.


## Grading

- <span style="color:blue">**21%**</span> Quality and thoroughness of paper reviews: 21% (7 x 3%); best 7 of 8
- <span style="color:blue">**12%**</span> Surprise in-class quizzes: 12% (4 x 3%); best 4 of 5; no-fault
- <span style="color:blue">**10%**</span> Discussion presentation
- <span style="color:blue">**57%**</span> Project
    - 40% x 57%: Final presentation. 
    - 60% x 57%: Report.


### Project Performance Metrics
The key metrics for the survey projects are diligence, precision, and technical depth, while creativity and independence are additional metrics for the research projects. The students that perform outstandingly in the research projects will be encouraged to continue working on the project under the instructor's guidance to publish at a top research venue.


## Classroom Rules
- No late days for submitting the paper reviews and the project report.
- Students are encouraged to ask questions and participate in the discussions. Please raise your hand before asking questions or speaking during the lectures.
- If plagiarism is detected in the paper reviews, the University authorities will be notified immediately for appropriate disciplinary action to be taken.
- Harassment or intimidation of any form against any student will not be tolerated in class.
